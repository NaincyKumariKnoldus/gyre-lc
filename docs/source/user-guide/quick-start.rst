Quick Start
==============================

To get started with GYRE-lc, follow these six simple steps:

- download & install the `MESA Software Development Kit (SDK) <http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesasdk>`_;
- download & install `MSG <http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/docs/msg/>`_;
- download the `GYRE-lc <https://github.com/aaronesque/gyre-lc>`_ source code
- unpack the source code using the ``tar`` utility;
- set the ``GYRELC_DIR`` environment variable to point to the newly created source directory;
- compile GYRE-lc using the command **make -C $GYRELC_DIR**.

For a more in-depth installation guide that covers additional use-cases, refer to the Installation chapter. If the code doesn’t compile properly, consult the troubleshooting chapter. Otherwise, proceed to the next chapter where you’ll learn to run your first GYRE-lc calculation.
