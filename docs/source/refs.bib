Tidal distortions or tidal responsese, not pulsations (that implies free oscillations)
	Mention that it relies on GYRE-tides, which is not yet released
	Tell melissa to bring up TAA for 10 mins to prospies
	Tell people to set MSG_DIR
	tell people to import sys and os
	make the models clickable for downloading
