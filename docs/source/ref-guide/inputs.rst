**********************
Namelist Input Files
**********************

GYRE-lc reads parameters from an *inlist*, which is an input file that defines a number of "namelist" groups. Inlists are an input format designed for Fortran, and GYRE-lc is presently written entirely in Python. However, the Fortran-heavy workflow for GYRE and MESA users makes inlists a naturally convenient way to categorize groups of inputs for GYRE-lc.
