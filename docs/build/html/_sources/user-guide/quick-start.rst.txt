Quick Start
=====================================

To get started with MSG, follow these five simple steps:

install the MESA Software Development Kit;

download the MSG source code;

unpack the source code using the tar utility;

set the MSG_DIR environment variable to point to the newly created source directory;

compile MSG using the command make -C $MSG_DIR.

For a more in-depth installation guide that covers alternative use-cases, refer to the Installation chapter. If the code doesn’t compile properly, consult the troubleshooting chapter. Otherwise, proceed to the next chapter where you’ll put together your first MSG calculation.
